## Description

The Social Network API is a backend service that enables users to register, share thoughts, react to posts, and manage friend relationships. Designed for flexibility and scalability, it leverages Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and MongoDB (with Mongoose) to provide robust data modeling, validation, and error handling. This API is ideal for learning backend development, RESTful design, and NoSQL data structures.

---

## Features

-   User registration and management
-   CRUD operations for thoughts
-   Add and remove friends
-   React to thoughts (add/remove reactions)
-   Virtual properties for friend and reaction counts
-   Data validation and error handling
-   Seed script for populating the database with sample data

---

## Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
-   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (local or cloud)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (for cloning)

---

## Technologies Used

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
-   [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
-   [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
-   [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd social-network-api
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

    ```env
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/socialNetworkDB
    PORT=3001
    ```

    > **Note:** Never commit your real `.env` file to version control. Only commit `.env.example` with placeholder values.

4. **Build the TypeScript files:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

5. **Seed the database (optional):**

    ```bash
    npm run seed
    ```

6. **Start the server:**

    - **Development mode:**

        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```

    - **Production mode:**

        ```bash
        npm start
        ```

    The API will be available at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## API Documentation

See [API.md](./API.md) for a full list of available endpoints and usage examples.

---

## Usage

1. Use an API client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to interact with the endpoints.
2. Create users, add thoughts, add friends, and react to thoughts using the documented endpoints in [API.md](./API.md).
3. Use the seed script to populate the database with sample users and thoughts for testing.

## Notes

-   The codebase is written in TypeScript and is heavily commented for clarity.
-   The repository includes a seed script for quickly populating the database with sample data.
-   All environment variables should be stored in a `.env` file and never committed to version control.
